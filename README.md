# not-a-very-safe-career-path
Repository to track my coding hours. 2.0 project written in Juilia based off original project started in Python. 

This project is dedicated to the memory of Larry Lee Jones (1944 - 2017), creator of the National Tennis Rating Program Software Algoritem. 

 "The first significant payout before any job offers was about three years 
 after I started and after writing code for three or four thousand hours
 with no financial return. Not a very safe career path but it worked out."
